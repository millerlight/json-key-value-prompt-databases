  "double exposure": " Create an intricate double exposure piece. The image should incorporate elements of fragmentation, drama, and macabre while remaining strongly tethered to glitchcore aesthetics. The image should include a silhouette, blending seamlessly into the moon, stars, and the fantasy tones of the piece. Convert this concept into high definition, vibrant, surrealist artwork, infused with hyper-details and hypermaximalist explorations. Use design elements found in manga and anime artwork, reminiscent of Japanese illustration techniques, found on platforms like Pixiv, Zerochan, and Fantia. Aim for the level of detailed surrealist collage art \"",
